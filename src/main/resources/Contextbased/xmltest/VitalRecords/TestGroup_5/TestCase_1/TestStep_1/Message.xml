    Disclaimer: 
    This sample file is informative only.
    This sample file contains representative data elements from the eICR IG. 
    The file depicts a fictional character's health data. Any resemblance to a real person is coincidental.
    To illustrate as many data elements as possible, the clinical scenario may not be entirely plausible. 
    The data in this sample file is not intended to represent a real patients, people or clinical events. 
    This sample is designed to be used in conjunction with the eICR IG.
     
    Where guidance has been given to the conformance or cardinality of elements or
    attributes and there is a discrepancy with the IG, the IG is always the normative
    source of truth.
    
    Please note:  This sample is valid against the Schema and Schematron for ERRORS (not warnings). 
    Logical schematron WARNINGS will generate from the sample file. 
    It is logical to generate a samples file from a system with valid warnings.

<!-- 
  Templates are identified in comments above their template id.  
  The IG in which the template version was first published is identified in square brackets before the template name.
  
  e.g.: [C-CDA 2.1] Continuity of Care (CCD) (V3)       indicates that the Discharge Summary (V3) template was first published in IG C-CDA R2.1
        [C-CDA R2.0] Plan of Treatment Section (V2)     indicates that the Plan of Treatment Section (V2) template was first published in IG C-CDA R2.0
        [C-CDA R1.1] History of Present Illness Section indicates that the Hospital Course Section was first published in IG C-CDA R1.1
        
  Even though all 3 templates above are included in IG C-CDA 2.1, because there have been no new versions of 
  the History of Present Illness Section template in IGs later than C-CDA R1.1, it is considered to be published in R1.1. 
  Similarly, there have been no new versions of the Plan of Treatment Section template later than C-CDA R.2 so it 
  is considered to be published in R2.0.
